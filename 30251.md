# [#30251](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32051) - p2p: protect addnode peers during IBD

*Read [here](https://github.com/i-am-yuvi/bitcoin-ibd/blob/master/block_stalling.md) how stalling process happens in bitcoin core*

## Abstract
While doing initial block download (IBD) over a fluctuating and slow internet connection, 
I observed very frequent peer disconnections in the debug log, on the order of 100+ per hour. 
These disconnections were often of manually added “addnode” peers, and logged as Peer is stalling block download, disconnecting <peer>. 
Ping requests to these peers often took 20-100 seconds.

Even after IBD was completed, addnode peer disconnections still happened:

Timeout downloading block <hex>, disconnecting <peer>

When an addnode peer is disconnected by the IBD headers/blocks download timeout or stalling logic, `ThreadOpenAddedConnections` attempts to immediately reconnect it – unless “onetry” was passed to the addnode RPC – up to the limit of 8 addnode connections. This limit is separate from the regular peer connection limits.

`ThreadOpenAddedConnections` will continue to attempt reconnection of the disconnected addnode peer until it succeeds.

When these disconnection/reconnection cycles happen frequently with addnode peers, it is likely network, resource and time intensive. 
This is particularly true for I2P peers, as these involve destroying and rebuilding 2 tunnels for each peer connection. It seems worth avoiding this if it is straightforward to do so.

Automatic (non-addnode) peers are also disconnected by the same logic, but they are a different category and case (non-protected peers, no immediate connection/reconnection) 
that would require monitoring over time to adjust the timeouts accordingly. Martin Zumsande was looking into 
optimizing this (see https://bitcoin-irc.chaincode.com/bitcoin-core-dev/2025-01-22#1083993): “The challenge is to distinguish this 
situation from making things worse for fast/reliable connections that just have some slow peers which should be disconnected.”

The goal of this pull request is thus to avoid unnecessary frequent disconnections and immediate reconnections of addnode peers, 
both during IBD and afterwards.

+        const auto adjusted_timeout{pto->IsManualConn() ? BLOCK_STALLING_TIMEOUT_MAX : stalling_timeout};
+        if (state.m_stalling_since.count() && state.m_stalling_since < current_time - adjusted_timeout) {
```

We are increasing the timeout here to `BLOCK_STALLING_TIMEOUT_MAX`(64 secs) instead of infinite time as the addnode peer might be slow and congested, see [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32051#pullrequestreview-2691505746)
Later changing the `if` condition with the updated timeout of the peer is addnode peer, else do not change it!

If the peer is addnode peer, we won't disconnect it instead display a message saying, block stalling from addnode peer. There's an interesting [comment](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32051/commits/3463a7f4813c3eece5ba9a260670a76e3f8d38ab#r1999313868)
in the PR which mentions that this check is not specific to IBD but normal operation as well so if the addnode peer is stalling why not disconnect it?

```
Here, we won't disconnect the peer for slow initial header sync downloads.
